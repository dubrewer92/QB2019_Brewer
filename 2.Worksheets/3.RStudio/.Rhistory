## OVERVIEW
This worksheet introduces some of the basic features of the R computing environment (http://www.r-project.org).
It is designed to be used along side the **3. RStudio** handout in your binder.
You will not be able to complete the exercises without the corresponding handout.
## Directions:
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Complete as much of the worksheet as possible during class.
3. Use the handout as a guide; it contains a more complete description of data sets along with examples of proper scripting needed to carry out the exercises.
4. Answer questions in the  worksheet.
Space for your answers is provided in this document and is indicated by the ">" character.
If you need a second paragraph be sure to start the first line with ">".
You should notice that the answer is highlighted in green by RStudio.
5. Before you leave the classroom today, it is *imperative* that you **push** this file to your GitHub repo.
6. When you have completed the worksheet, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file by pressing the `Knit` button in the RStudio scripting panel.
This will save the PDF output in your '3.RStudio' folder.
8. After Knitting, please submit the worksheet by making a **push** to your GitHub repo and then create a **pull request** via GitHub.
Your pull request should include this file (**3.RStudio_Worksheet.Rmd**) with all code blocks filled out and questions answered) and the PDF output of `Knitr` (**3.RStudio_Worksheet.pdf**).
The completed exercise is due on **Wednesday, January 16^th^, 2019 before 12:00 PM (noon)**.
## 1) HOW WE WILL BE USING R AND OTHER TOOLS
You are working in an RMarkdown (.Rmd) file.
This allows you to integrate text and R code into a single document.
There are two major features to this document: 1) Markdown formatted text and 2) "chunks" of R code.
Anything in an R code chunk will be interpreted by R when you *Knit* the document.
When you are done, you will *knit* your document together.
However, if there are errors in the R code contained in your Markdown document, you will not be able to knit a PDF file.
If this happens, you will need to review your code, locate the source of the error(s), and make the appropriate changes.
Even if you are able to knit without issue, you should review the knitted document for correctness and completeness before you submit the Worksheet.
## 2) SETTING YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
In the R code chunk below, please provide the code to:
1) clear your R environment,
2) print your current working directory, and
3) set your working directory to your '3.RStudio' folder.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/dusti/GitHub/QB2019_Brewer/2.Worksheets/3.RStudio")
```
## 3) USING R AS A CALCULATOR
To follow up on the pre-class exercises, please calculate the following in the R code chunk below.
Feel free to reference the **1. Introduction to version control and computing tools** handout.
1) the volume of a cube with length, l, = 5 (volume = l^3 )
2) the area of a circle with radius, r, = 2 (area = pi * r^2).
3) the length of the opposite side of a right-triangle given that the angle, theta, = pi/4. (radians, a.k.a. 45Â°) and with hypotenuse length sqrt(2) (remember: sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse).
4) the log (base e) of your favorite number.
```{r}
5^3
pi * 2^2
sin(pi/4) * sqrt(2)
log(22)
```
## 4) WORKING WITH VECTORS
To follow up on the pre-class exercises, please perform the requested operations in the R-code chunks below.
### Basic Features Of Vectors
In the R-code chunk below, do the following:
1) Create a vector `x` consisting of any five numbers.
2) Create a new vector `w` by multiplying `x` by 14 (i.e., "scalar").
3) Add `x` and `w` and divide by 15.
```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 3, 8)
w <- x*14
(x+w)/15
```
Now, do the following:
1) Create another vector (`k`) that is the same length as `w`.
2) Multiply `k` by `x`.
3) Use the combine function to create one more vector, `d` that consists of any three elements from `w` and any four elements of `k`.
```{r}
k <- c(2, 6, 8, 2, 4)
k*x
d <- c(14, 70, 112, 1, 2, 8, 2)
```
### Summary Statistics of Vectors
In the R-code chunk below, calculate the **summary statistics** (i.e., maximum, minimum, sum, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean) for the vector (`v`) provided.
```{r}
v <- c(16.4, 16.0, 10.1, 16.8, 20.5, 20.2, 13.1, 24.8, 20.2, 25.0, 20.5, 30.5, 31.4, 27.1)
max(v)
min(v)
sum(v)
mean(v)
median(v)
var(v)
sd(v)
sem <- function(X){sd(X)/sqrt(length(X))}
sem(v)
```
## 5) WORKING WITH MATRICES
In the R-code chunk below, do the following:
Using a mixture of Approach 1 and 2 from the **3. RStudio** handout, create a matrix with two columns and five rows.
Both columns should consist of random numbers.
Make the mean of the first column equal to 8 with a standard deviation of 2 and the mean of the second column equal to 25 with a standard deviation of 10.
```{r}
help(rnorm)
vector1 <- c(rnorm(5, mean = 8, sd = 2))
vector2 <- c(rnorm(5, mean = 25, sd = 10))
matrix <- matrix(c(vector1, vector2), nrow = 5, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
matrix
```
str(meso)
meso <- read.table("data/zoop_nuts.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
meso <- read.table("data/zoops_nuts.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
meso <- read.table("data/zoop_nuts.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
