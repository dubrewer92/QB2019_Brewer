I was raised in northern Indiana, and am interested in conservation biology. Most of my researh experience has involved studying avian ecology. I am also interested in studying acoustics. Something that you may not know about me is that I enjoy writing fiction. 

I expect that this course will 1.) greatly improve my ability to use R, 2.) introduce me to how GitHub works and 3.) improve my ability to analyze my data.
